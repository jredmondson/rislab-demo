[TOC]

Welcome to the Doxygen documentation site that is autogenerated with
the latest changes to GAMS and MADARA versions of the multirotor vision
that has existed for years in the Rislab at the CMU Robotics Lab.

\section hivemind Hivemind Introduction

![Hivemind Architecture](TheHivemindArchitecture.png)

The Shield AI software vision can be best viewed through the Hivemind lens.
Hivemind is a design of agent software that centers around a knowledge base,
currently provided by the MADARA knowledge-sharing project for real-time,
outdoor systems. Hivemind is the combination of three concepts: an Intelligence
Kernel, a Knowledge Base, and external or Exogenous Systems that interact with
the Intelligence Kernel or Knowledge Base.

![Intelligence Kernel](TheIntelligenceKernel.png)

The repo has an example scaffolding and implementation of an Intelligence
Kernel for the Rislab Multirotor platform to be used in simulations or
real-world demos. The repo is meant to show how a single repo can potentially
support both simulation and real-world platform drivers without causing
confusion, performance issues, or a need to manage many different git
repos per platform driver, platform configuration, etc.

![Rislab QuadPlatform](RislabQuadPlatform.png)

To give a visualization of one such Intelligence Kernel implementation,
consider the above diagram of an example trace through the Rislab Simulation
Quadcopter platform driver. The driver has four threads: Controls, Mapping,
State Estimation, and Teleop Override. These are configurable in the
platforms::RisQuadcopterSim class to run at whatever hertz rate developers
prefer. Each of these threads has C++ containers that point into the
high performance MADARA knowledge base provided to the platform driver by
the Agent Controller (codified in src/controller.cpp).

We've made a custom container data structure called
containers::ControlVariables, which contains orientation, position, and other
control-related variables sourced from some of the existing ROS-based code
in the quadcopter_simulator project on Gitlab.

Here are some interesting places to look in the API documentation:

1. The above platform driver can be found at platforms::RisQuadcopterSim
   (src/platforms/RisQuadcopterSim.cpp)
2. The platform driver threads can be found in platforms::threads
3. Example container classes can be found in the containers namespace
    1. Controls currently has its own container data structure at containers::ControlVariables
4. An exploration algorithm stub has been added at algorithms::ExploreGpsDenied
    1. An algorithm differs from a thread in that an algorithm is usually a mission that can be changed at runtime
    2. Threads tend to persist in all missions
